# Talent vs luck; agent based simulation

Based on the ideas in the 2018 article "Talent versus luck: the role of randomness in success and failure"
by A. Pluchino et al.

## Setup

The simulation is straight forward to get started with, simply run the main.py script.

## To do

- implement fixed salaries for agents to compare in the end what mattered most wrt wealth; steady salary or luck?
